# Abstract

A strong negation in da Costa's systems can be 
naturally extended from the strong negation 
(¬) of . In [Newton C. A. da Costa. On the theory of 
inconsistent formal systems. Notre Dame Journal of Formal 
Logic, 15(4):497–510, 10 1974] Newton da Costa 
proved the connectives $\{\rightarrow, \land, \lor, \neg\}$ in $C_1$ 
satisfy all schemas and 
inference rules of classical logic. In the following paper 
we present a proof that all logics in the $C_n$ hierarchy 
also behave classically as $C_1$. 
This result tell us the existance of a common property among 
the paraconsistent family of logics created by da Costa.
