*** Abstract 

In this paper we motivate the study of Kripke semantics for propositional
intuitionistic logic by showing fundamental properties at the proof theory level
using $n+1$-valued logics. Some non-theorems of propositional intuitionistic
logic (like the excludded middle principle) are discussed using this approach.
