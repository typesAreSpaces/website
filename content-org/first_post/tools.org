**** Hugo

This static generator is used for building the main components of the website. Its main features are:

- Editing using markdown: It uses the go programming language to 'compile' html files from markdown files.
- 'Capable Templating': I understand this as convenient code which enables users to programatically structure websites using special variables within markdown.
- Extensive selection of themes: As I already mentioned before, we will particularly focus on the academic theme.

Here are some installation options for some operating systems:

- macOs

  #+begin_src bash
    brew install hugo
  #+end_src

- Windows

  #+begin_src bash 
    choco install hugo --confirm
  #+end_src

- Debian/Ubuntu

  #+begin_src bash 
    sudo apt-get install hugo
  #+end_src

- Arch Linux

  #+begin_src bash 
    sudo pacman -Syu hugo
  #+end_src

- Fedora, Red Hat and CentOS

  #+begin_src bash 
    sudo dnf install hugo
  #+end_src

- openSUSE

  #+begin_src bash 
    sudo zypper install hugo
  #+end_src

- Solus

  #+begin_src bash 
    sudo eopkg install hugo
  #+end_src

- OpenBSD

  #+begin_src bash 
    doas pkg_add hugo
  #+end_src

**** Academic theme

The theme focuses on academic settings like portfolios, cvs, resumes, conference websites, etc. The [[https://wowchemy.com/docs/][project]] is well documented and provides good support for academic needs. For example, the author of the theme provides a tool called [[https://pypi.org/project/academic/][Hugo Academic CLI]] which can generate publication entries from a bibtex file. 

In order to install the theme:
1. Select the `Academic Resume` from https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/
2. Click on `Start with Academic Resume`
3. Choose either Github or Gitlab to fork the content of the theme into a git repository
4. Finish the process by clicking on the 'Save & Deploy' button.

The latter will fork the content of the theme from Netlify. The latter will create a website hosted by Netlify. If you already have a domain, e.g. a personal website or some url from your university, I'd recommed just to keep track of the content from either Github or Gitlab.

#+CAPTION: If you chose the default name, the following repo should appear in your account
#+NAME:    fig:academic_theme_content

**** [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][Ox-hugo]] (optional)

If you're an emacs user who likes org-mode, the ox-hugo package comes handy to organize your posts and use org instead of markdown.

Add the following to your init.el configuration file to obtain hugo:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'ox
    (require 'ox-hugo))
#+end_src

If you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], use this instead:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (use-package ox-hugo
    :ensure t   ;Auto-install the package from Melpa
    :pin melpa  ;`package-archives' should already have ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
    :after ox)
  #+end_src
